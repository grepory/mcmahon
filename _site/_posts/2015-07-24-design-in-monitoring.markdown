I've been working as a product designer in the monitoring industry for the last 5 years. For too long, the conversation in monitoring has been dominated by getting more metrics and better resolution in data capture, with little attention paid to the operator experience. Our job as makers of monitoring tools is to help users down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop" target="_blank">the path from observation to action</a>. This begins with contextually rich notifications and ends with meaningful action taken by the user. It's up to us to fill in the gaps.

There are some products setting good examples that we can learn from, and we at Opsee hope to be one of them. In this talk from <a href="http://monitorama.com/" target="_blank">Monitorama 2015</a>, I discuss the state of the monitoring industry as I see it today, and what we can do to improve it:
